# lampyrid

Analysis examining what factors may affect lampyrid abundance in Southwest Michigan. Data were obtained from a publicly available dataset at http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/datatables. Lampyrid abundance was quantified using yellow sticky traps over time across various habitat treatments that have been established in Hickory Corners, MI at Kellogg Bioloigcal Station's Long Term Ecological Research Station since the late 1980's. 

We collaboratively came up with biological hypotheses, cleaned and formatted the dataset, analysed the data and wrote the manuscript.
